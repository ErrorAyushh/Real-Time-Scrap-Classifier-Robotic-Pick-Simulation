 ## Real-Time Scrap Classifier & Robotic Pick Simulation  

This project demonstrates a **real-time waste classification system** using **MobileNetV2** for image classification and a **robotic pick simulation** to visualize automated waste sorting.  
The goal is to classify different types of scrap (metal, plastic, paper, etc.) and simulate how a robotic arm could pick and place items accordingly.

## ðŸ”¹ 1. Approach  

### Dataset Preparation  
- Used the **Garbage Image Dataset (TrashType_Image_Dataset)** (~2500+ images).  
- Organized images into categories (plastic, metal, paper, glass, etc.).  
- Applied preprocessing steps such as resizing, normalization, and augmentation.  

### Model Training (MobileNetV2)  
- Implemented **MobileNetV2**, a lightweight CNN optimized for image classification.  
- Fine-tuned on the dataset with transfer learning.  
- **Achieved 84% classification accuracy** on the validation set.  

### Real-Time Classification  
- Integrated with a live webcam feed.  
- Each detected item is classified instantly and displayed with labels.  

### Robotic Pick Simulation  
- Simulated how a robotic arm could automatically pick and place classified items into respective bins.  
- Acts as a **proof-of-concept** for smart waste management systems.
